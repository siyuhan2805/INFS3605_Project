# INFS3605_Project Pitch App

Hi Michael, welcome to our INFS3605 capstone application, UniGlobe!

To help you navigate through the files, our "Master" branch contains our integration of Tableau. If you want to experience what we demonstrated on the walkthrough from the 20minute video, please navigate to "Henry's Branch" and run the code there. It should be an exact copy of what we submitted in the pitch video.

For best practices and the best results, please use Pixel 4a with the R release name to allow for compatibility to the Google API. Given that there is a SQLITE database as the backend of the file, if you encounter any issues when trying to log-on, please going into "Device Manager" -> "Wipe Data" to ensure a clean slate instance of the app. This will reset the SQLITE database and allow you to view our app from scratch

Hope you enjoy our solution :)

Kind regards, Group C T18A
